# VDAB-pneumatic-box-pusher
For this project I was to create, from sheet metal and pneumatic components only, a system that would
push boxes of certain size that were provided in front of the cylinder. <br>
<br>
The contraption is to only push when all of the following conditions are met: <br>
• The cylinder is in the starting position.<br>
• A button is held down or a switch flipped with the purpose of turning the system on and active.<br>
• A box is detected at the input position.<br>
<br>
The cylinder should return when a box is detected at the output and should only extend again when said
box is removed. The cylinder should extend slower to not damage or launch the boxes and retract quickly
to speed up the process.
