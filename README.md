# VDAB-pneumatic-box-pusher
For this project I was to create, from sheet metal and pneumatic components only, a system that would
push boxes of certain size that were provided in front of the cylinder. <br>
<br>
The contraption is to only push when all of the following conditions are met: <br>
• The cylinder is in the starting position.<br>
• A button is held down or a switch flipped with the purpose of turning the system on and active.<br>
• A box is detected at the input position.<br>
<br>
The cylinder should return when a box is detected at the output and should only extend again when said
box is removed. The cylinder should extend slower to not damage or launch the boxes and retract quickly
to speed up the process.

The video file added is not viewable on each device, here is a googlde drive url for those unable to see it:<br>

The pneumatic schema was made and can be viewed in the fluidSIM 5 pneumatics application.


The 3d model was made in Autodesk Fusion for personal use. There is also a model for catching the box and detecting when a box has reached the output. This contraption will in later projects be replaced by one that will move the box aside automatically.<br>
The "plexiglass surrounding" component is meant to design a surrounding of plexiglass to make the construction safe for people to use without hurting themselves.<br>
The pieces of sheetmetal with 5mm wide slits are to fit the pneumatic sensors on, for detecting the box, or the cylinder position.<br>
The holes on the sides of both contraptions are to fit pneumatic connectors, so that someone can connect the pressurized tubes to the sensors and cylinder without having to access inside of the contraption.
